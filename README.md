# ELK Stack Log Analysis - Scenario Testing

This README.md file provides a summary of the scenario testing process for log analysis using the ELK Stack and Logstash. The testing focuses on two scenarios: 

## Scenario 1: Log File Processing
In this scenario, the demo application writes logs to a log file, which serves as the input for Logstash. The following steps outline the testing process:

1. Run the ELK Stack using the provided docker-compose.yaml file.
2. Execute the Spring demo app and make requests to generate logs.
3. View the logs in the specified file.
4. Stop the app to release the lock on the log file.
5. Access Kibana's "Discover" tab, create an index pattern, and view the logs.

## Scenario 2: Real-Time Log Processing
The second scenario involves configuring the logback library to send logs directly to Logstash, enabling real-time log processing. The testing process is as follows:

1. Re-run the demo app and the ELK Stack.
2. Create a new index pattern in Kibana.
3. Navigate to the "Discover" tab and view the logs.
4. Generate logs through API calls.
5. Observe the prompt display of processed logs in the Kibana interface.

By following these testing procedures, users can evaluate the functionality of log analysis with the ELK Stack and Logstash, providing valuable insights for application monitoring and troubleshooting.
